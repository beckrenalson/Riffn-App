## 1: Planning & Design

    Define core MVP features (musician profiles, band needs, filtering)

    Research similar platforms (BandMix, Vampr)

    Create wireframes and UI mockups

    Define brand (name, logo, colors)

    Set up development tools and repositories

## 2: Backend Setup

    Implement authentication (email or OAuth)

    Create database models:

        Users (musician/band)

        Profiles (instruments, genres, media)

        Match posts (band openings)

    Set up media storage (audio/video samples)

    Begin testing APIs

## 3: Frontend Development – Profiles & Search

    Build profile creation/edit screens

    Implement band opening listings

    Add filtering (genre, instrument, location)

    Link frontend to backend APIs

## 4: Messaging & Matching

    Create match display system (basic swiping or list-based)

    Add basic messaging functionality (Firebase or simple chat API)

    Enable “request to connect” functionality for matches

## 5: Testing & Polish

    Internal bug testing and performance checks

    Small beta group testing (local musicians)

    Collect feedback on search, profile flows, and messaging

    Fix bugs and polish UI/UX

## 6: Launch

    Deploy vercel

    Promote through local music groups and forums

    Monitor early usage metrics

    Provide support for initial users

## 7: Iteration & Optimization

    Address post-launch bugs or UI issues

    Improve filtering/matching logic based on feedback

    Prepare marketing materials or landing page

    Final review before wider release
