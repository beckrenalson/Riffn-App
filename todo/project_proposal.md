# PROJECT PROPOSAL: Riffn
Filter users depending on what the users profile type is. If the user selects solo artist, it returns a list of users that created a band profile and has and opening for the solo artists selected instruments, genres, and location and vice versa if the band wants to search for a musician for their band, the list shows them a list of artists that meet their selected instruments, genres, and location

## Problem Statement
- Musicians have trouble finding bands to join 
- Facebook groups and forums are difficult to navigate and have to manually write out their description of who they are/ their band, preferences.
- Contact details are not allowed on facebook groups, requiring direct message. Security issues when posting personal information onto forums

## WOW Factor
- Does not require user to put a lot of personal details on their profile, using social media handles instead to gain contact with others.
- Clean and straight to the point ui/ux making forming bands more intuitive for the user.
- Easy selection process for the musician to select their preferences during signup and interation

## Test Users

- Tomo
- Victor
- Darren
