Okay heres the big component, the piece de resistance. I want to filter users depending on what the users profileType is. If the user selects solo artist, it returns a list of users that created a band profile and has and opening for the solo artists selected instruments and genres and vice versa if the band wants to search for a musician for their band, the list shows them a list of artists that meet their selected intruments and genres

A system where:

A solo artist can see bands that want their instruments and genres.

A band can see solo artists who match their needed instruments and genres.

Results are shown in the frontend as a clickable list.

Test Case 1: Solo
Choose profileType = "solo"

Pick selectedInstruments + selectedGenres

Submit → stored in DB with no openings

Test Case 2: Band
Choose profileType = "band"

Pick openings.instruments + openings.genres

Submit → stored in DB with openings included
